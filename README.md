👻 Ghosts 'N Goblins – University Project

🎮 Description
This project is a recreation of Ghosts 'N Goblins, developed as part of a university programming assignment. The game was selected by my professor at the University of Parma (Università di Parma) as the required project for the course.

🧩 Development
I built the game from scratch, focusing on reproducing:

⚔️ The core gameplay mechanics

👾 Enemy behavior and animations

🏰 Level design and progression

🎨 Smooth performance and responsive controls

💡 Technical Focus
The project allowed me to apply key programming concepts such as:

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

🔄 Game loop and update cycles

🎯 Collision detection

🕹️ Sprite animation and event handling

📚 Goal
To recreate a classic arcade experience while improving my understanding of game architecture, code structure, and real-time graphics.
